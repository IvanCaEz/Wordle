## How To Play

- The user has 6 tries to guess the right word
- Each word has 5 characters
- If the background of the character of the guessed word
  changes to **gray** it means it doesn't exist in the word.
- If changes to **yellow** it means it exists in
  the word but is not in the correct position.
- If  changes to **green** it means it is in the
  correct position.

### The Game
- The user can choose to play in Catalan or in English.
- First will ask the user to type their username.
- Then will take a random word from the `wordPool` of the choosen language and will ask the user for a word.
- If the word doesn't have a length of 5 chars or has chars that aren't alphabetical, it will throw a warning and will ask
  for a word again.

##### When the word is accepted and isn't the right guess

- It will scan every char at the `userGuess` word and compare
  the position with the same position of the char of the random
  word.
- At the same time will be colored based on the position and added
  to a variable called `history`
- Then it will be added to a list called `historyList` and with each iteration will print the content
  of the list creating the history of the game
- The program will also print the number of the current round.
- Last it will rest 1 try and will communicate to the user how many tries has.
